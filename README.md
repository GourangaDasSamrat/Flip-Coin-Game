# 🎉🪙 Flip Coin Game! 🪙🎉

## ✨ Introduction ✨

Hey there! 👋 So, I whipped up this little project called the **Flip Coin Game**. It's a fun, interactive web game that lets you experience the classic coin toss right in your browser. Honestly, I just wanted to play around with some frontend stuff and make something simple but engaging. Whether you're curious about probabilities or just need a quick decision maker, this game is for you! Building this was a blast, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it. 😊
